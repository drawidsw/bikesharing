# Overview

In this exercise, bike rental data from a company in New York city is analyzed in Tableau to answer questions such as:
* Who are the main subscribers
* What times are bikes rented out the most
* What locations are bikes rented out the most
* Which bikes are rented out the used the most
* How many times on average are bikes rented out
* What is the average trip duration of the bike rental
* What is the breakdown of the subscribers based upon gender and age

This data will be analyzed and presented to the investors for an investment opportunity in the bike rental company. The company must prove it can operationalize and analyze this data to make bikes efficiently available where and when they are needed, and that the bikes are routinely maintained and repaired. This way, the company can maximize its revenue and thereby its profit while increasing the scale of bike rentals even more.
